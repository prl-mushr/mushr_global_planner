# Mushr Global Planner

## Setup:
- Install ompl from source [here](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/installation.html) with python bindings
    - If you have a segfault with CastXML on Ubuntu 16.04 as I did, install the binaries from [here](https://data.kitware.com/#collection/57b5c9e58d777f126827f5a1/folder/57b5de948d777f10f2696370). You will need to put the contents of `.../castxml/bin` into `/usr/local/bin/` and `.../castxml/share` into `/usr/local/share`. Also, uninstall your current version of cast xml `sudo apt remove castxml` 
    - make sure you have the [following](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/installPyPlusPlus.html) installed
- Clone this repo into `.../catkin_ws/src/`:   
    `git clone https://github.com/thompsonmax/mushr_global_planner.git`
- Make and source your workspace. (Assuming source commands in .bashrc)
    `cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make && source ~/.bashrc`

## Demo
We have a pre-built demo that is easy to use just run the following:  
`roslaunch mushr_global_planner demo.launch`  
Then open rviz  
`rviz`  
After a minute, if you subscribe to the `/mushr_global_planner_result` topic you should see a red path.

## Using Mushr Global Planner
To use the global planner simply launch `planner.launch`  
`roslaunch mushr_global_planner planner.launch`  
Or include it in your own launch file. Note, the default planner does not launch a map server so that will need to be running separately.

To call the planner, simply make a service request using the API:  
- start position is in world frame
- goal position is in world frame
- turning radius is the turning radius of the car. You can calculate your turning radius although we recommend you tune your car to match your expected turning radius. You should match the variables to the vesc settings preset [car length](https://github.com/prl-mushr/vesc/blob/master/vesc_main/config/racecar-uw-nano/vesc.yaml) and [delta](https://github.com/prl-mushr/mushr_base/blob/master/mushr_base/config/joy_teleop.yaml) (steering angle).

- planning time is the planning time cutoff. E.g. give me your best solution after 30 seconds
